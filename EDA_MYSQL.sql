-- ADVANCED QUERIES

-- Write an SQL query to generate a report that shows:
  -- The total number of layoffs for each month (in 'YYYY-MM' format).
  -- A running (cumulative) total of layoffs across all months, ordered chronologically.
-- Your output should include two columns:
     -- dates: Month in 'YYYY-MM' format
     -- rolling_total_layoffs: Cumulative sum of total_laid_off up to that month
