Global Tech Layoffs Analysis using MySQL
This project dives deep into the wave of layoffs in the tech industry using structured SQL analysis. It is thoughtfully divided into two key phases: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
We analyzed a real-world dataset containing layoff records across companies, countries, and industries over multiple years. The goal was to clean and prepare the data for meaningful insights using pure SQL, showcasing data wrangling, transformation, and analytical skillsâ€”essential for data analyst roles.

ðŸ§¹ Phase 1: Data Cleaning (MySQL)
The raw data had inconsistencies like duplicates, null values, and inconsistent formatting. We cleaned it using best SQL practices:

Removed duplicate records using ROW_NUMBER()

Handled null and blank values across key columns

Standardized inconsistent text (e.g., spacing, casing in industry/country columns)

Formatted date fields properly for time-based analysis

Created a clean, analysis-ready version of the original table

ðŸ“Š Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (MySQL)
Once the data was cleaned, we used SQL queries to derive key insights:

Identified companies and industries with the highest layoffs

Found top countries affected by layoffs

Tracked layoff trends over months and years

Analyzed cases where companies laid off 100% of staff

Explored funding raised vs layoffs

Summarized total layoffs by each category using GROUP BY, ORDER BY, aggregation functions, and filtering
